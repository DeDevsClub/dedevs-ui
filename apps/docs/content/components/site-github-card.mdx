## Overview

The `GitHub Card` is a client component that fetches a GitHub user's profile via the public GitHub API and renders a polished profile card with avatar, bio, stats, links, and a contributions heatmap-style grid.

Features:

- __Search input__: Look up any GitHub username.
- __Profile info__: Avatar, name/login, bio, social links, email/blog when available.
- __Stats__: Followers, following, public repos.
- __Contributions grid__: GitHub-like weekly activity visualization.
- __Share actions__: Quick share to Twitter/X and LinkedIn.

Note: The component uses the public GitHub REST API and is subject to unauthenticated rate limits.

## Usage

Import the component from `@repo/site` and render it in a client page or component:

```tsx
"use client";
import React from "react";
import { GitHubCard } from "@repo/site";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="container py-10">
      <GitHubCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```
