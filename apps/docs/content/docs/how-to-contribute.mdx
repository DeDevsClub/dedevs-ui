First off, thank you for considering contributing to DeDevs UI Design Registry!

The DeDevs UI Design Registry is a comprehensive component library focused on modern web applications across specialized domains including AI interfaces, blockchain applications, and developer portfolios. We welcome contributions of all kinds – from bug fixes and documentation improvements to new specialized components. This guide will help you get started with contributing, including setting up a development environment, our preferred workflow for making changes, and tips for submitting your pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute to DeDevs UI Design Registry. Feel free to pick the one that best suits your skills and interests.

## Bug Reports & Fixes

If you find a bug, you can open an issue describing it. Even better, if you track down the cause, feel free to submit a pull request with a fix. When fixing a bug, include a clear description of the problem and the solution in your PR. For specialized components, be sure to note any specific scenarios or use cases where the bug occurs.

## Documentation

Improvements to documentation are very valuable. This could mean fixing typos, clarifying examples, or adding new explanations. If something was unclear to you while using DeDevs UI Design Registry, updating the docs to help future users is a great contribution. Documentation on component usage across different application domains (AI, blockchain, portfolios) is especially helpful.

## New Components

Perhaps you built a specialized component that would be useful to others. You can contribute new components to the registry. Components that enhance AI interfaces, improve blockchain interactions, or create better portfolio presentations are particularly valuable. (See [New Components](/docs/new-components) for detailed guidelines.)

## Enhancements

You might have ideas to enhance existing components (e.g., add a new prop for a feature, improve accessibility, refactor for performance). We welcome these ideas—just make sure to discuss major changes with maintainers (via an issue or discussion) before investing a lot of time, to ensure it aligns with the project goals and the [DeDevs UI](https://github.com/DeDevsClub/dedevs-ui) framework principles that this registry is based on.
