description: Learn how to use DeDevs UI components across different application domains.
---

Once a DeDevs UI component is installed, you can import it and use it in your application like any other React component. The components are added as part of your codebase (not hidden in a library), so the usage feels very natural across all application domains.

## Examples

Let's explore how to use DeDevs UI components across different application domains:

### AI Interface Example

Here's how you might create a conversational AI interface:

```jsx
// AIInterface.tsx
'use client';

import {
  AIResponse,
  AIInput
} from '@/components/ui/dedevs-ui/ai';

const AIInterface = () => (
  <div className="flex flex-col h-[600px] space-y-4">
    <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
      <AIResponse>
        # Welcome to DeDevs UI
        
        This is an AI-powered interface built with DeDevs UI components.
        You can ask questions and get intelligent responses.
        
        **Features:**
        - Markdown rendering
        - Code syntax highlighting  
        - Responsive design
      </AIResponse>
    </div>
    
    <AIInput 
      placeholder="Ask a question..." 
      onSubmit={(message) => console.log('Submitted:', message)}
    />
  </div>
);

export default AIInterface;
```

### Blockchain/Web3 Example

Here's how you might create a Web3 dashboard:

```jsx
// Web3Dashboard.tsx
'use client';

import {
  WalletConnect,
  TokenBalance,
  TransactionHistory
} from '@/components/ui/dedevs-ui/web3';

const Web3Dashboard = () => (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
    <div className="col-span-full">
      <WalletConnect 
        onConnect={(address) => console.log('Connected:', address)}
      />
    </div>
    
    <TokenBalance 
      tokens={[
        { symbol: 'ETH', balance: '2.5', value: '$4,250' },
        { symbol: 'USDC', balance: '1,000', value: '$1,000' }
      ]}
    />
    
    <div className="col-span-full lg:col-span-2">
      <TransactionHistory 
        transactions={[
          { hash: '0x123...', type: 'send', amount: '0.1 ETH', status: 'confirmed' },
          { hash: '0x456...', type: 'receive', amount: '100 USDC', status: 'pending' }
        ]}
      />
    </div>
  </div>
);

export default Web3Dashboard;
```

### Developer Portfolio Example

Here's how you might create a professional portfolio:

```jsx
// Portfolio.tsx
'use client';

import {
  ProjectShowcase,
  CodeSnippet,
  SkillMatrix
} from '@/components/ui/dedevs-ui/portfolio';

const Portfolio = () => (
  <div className="space-y-12">
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Featured Projects</h2>
      <ProjectShowcase 
        projects={[
          {
            title: 'E-commerce Platform',
            description: 'Full-stack Next.js application with Stripe integration',
            tech: ['Next.js', 'TypeScript', 'Tailwind CSS', 'Stripe'],
            github: 'https://github.com/user/project',
            demo: 'https://project-demo.com'
          }
        ]}
      />
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Code Examples</h2>
      <CodeSnippet 
        language="typescript"
        code={`
const fetchUserData = async (id: string): Promise<User> => {
  const response = await fetch(\`/api/users/\${id}\`);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');
  return response.json();
};
        `}
      />
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Skills & Technologies</h2>
      <SkillMatrix 
        skills={[
          { name: 'React', level: 'Expert', years: 5 },
          { name: 'TypeScript', level: 'Advanced', years: 3 },
          { name: 'Node.js', level: 'Advanced', years: 4 }
        ]}
      />
    </section>
  </div>
);

export default Portfolio;
```

In the examples above, we import specialized components from our DeDevs UI directory and compose them to create complete interfaces for different application domains. Each component is designed to work seamlessly within its domain while maintaining consistency with shadcn's design system.

Feel free to add as many DeDevs UI components as you need. Because components are added on-demand, you're not including code for features you aren't using. This keeps your app lean. Each component is isolated, so adding one won't bloat another â€“ yet they all share the same design tokens (colors, fonts, etc.) from shadcn's theme.

## Extensibility

All DeDevs UI components take as many primitive attributes as possible. For example, most components extend standard HTML element attributes, so you can pass any props that the underlying element supports. This makes it easy to extend components with your own styles or functionality across all domains.

## Customization

After installation, no additional setup is needed. The components come with their styles (Tailwind CSS classes) and functionality built-in. You can start using them in your app right away, whether you're building AI interfaces, blockchain applications, developer portfolios, or any other specialized application type.
